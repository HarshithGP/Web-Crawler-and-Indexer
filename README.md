Developed and configured a web crawler built on top of the open source crawler4j library to crawl popular news website - nbcnews.com

Objective - To work with a simple web crawler to measure aspects of a crawl, study the characteristics of the crawl, download web pages from the crawl and gather webpage metadata, all from pre-selected news websites such as nbcnews.com

Made use of an existing open source Java web crawler called crawler4j which is built upon the open source crawler4j library.

Configured and compiled the crawler as follows - The maximum pages to fetch can be set in crawler4j and it should be set to 20,000 to ensure a reasonable execution time. The maximum depth was set to 16 to ensure that we limit the crawling.
